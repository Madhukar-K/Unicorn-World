# Unicorn World

This is my first **Power BI project**  and the data is from [Maven Unicorn Challange](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-unicorn-challenge/8) 

**About The Data Set**

Private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns.

 - **Step 1**

	 Looking at the type of data The first place I went was to view the data dictionary. This is as it helps gives an overview and context for the subject without giving too much away about the content. From an initial review, I divided the types of data up into several categories which could help me form a list of questions
	 
	- Dates – These can help form time and trend related questions
	- Money – These can form queries on average values, return on investment and growth
	- Geography – These can help make comparisons at several hierarchical levels
	- Companies – These can assist in analysis at both high and detailed levels from both and company and investor viewpoint
	
	**Step 2**
	
	 Here are a shortlist of questions I made:
	 
	
	 - Who are the Top Market Leaders in Unicorn world ? 
	 - Which industry is leading by numer of unicorns?
	 - What is the overall growth by year ? 
	 - How many years it takes a company to join the Unicron world?
	 - Return of Investment by Industry
	 -  Where in the world  are the highest prevalence for unicorns? 

	**Step 3**
		
	 The approach i took, was to split the questions into Four streams. Market,Growth , Return of Investment and Global
